My personal site hosting my articles, pictures of my dog, and other stuff I like 😊

## Developer notes

General notes:

- Some pages are tracked directly in the `site` folder, others are in the `pages` folder

Hosting tools:

- GitHub Pages
- namecheap.com

Developer tools:

- @types/node to silence false positive errors on references to Node globals
- Git LFS to better track changes to images
- GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the site
- http-server for testing the site
- Node.js to run QoL scripts
- Prettier to format the repo
