# markwiemer.com Trump Litigation Tracker

Building on previous efforts, this page is a responsive data-based table with advanced filtering and editable opinions on who's winning and losing each case. I expect this page to blow up around Thanksgiving :D

Previous efforts:

1. [Court Watch: Lawsuits Related to Trump Admin Actions](https://www.courtwatch.news/p/lawsuits-related-to-trump-admin-executive-orders), which includes court citations for each case but provides no further details. Still updated as of 2025-06-20
1. [Just Security: Trump Admin Litigation Tracker](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/), which uses Court Watch's citation list and publishes a detailed summary of each case including updates on rulings and other case events. Updated every few days.
    - We know they use Court Watch because their citation links occasionally include `utm_source=www.courtwatch.news`

Planned features unique to this tracker:

1. More responsive and advanced sorting and filtering
    - Apply multiple filters at once
    - New sort and filter categories
        - Alleged legal violations
        - Case status
        - Who's winning
1. Open, organized data availabe as a spreadsheet instead of just a webpage
1. Opinions on who's currently winning each case
    - Opinions can be modified if you disagree and want what you feel is a more accurate result
    - Opinions can be hidden if you want to reduce subjectivity
1. Summary view for each category
