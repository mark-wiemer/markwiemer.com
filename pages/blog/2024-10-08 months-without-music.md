I didn't get covid until December 2023. I didn't get healthy again until March, three months later. I thoroughly enjoyed scheduling an appointment for the Long Covid clinic in February only to learn they didn't have any openings until May. My doctor told me I was lucky to get in so early. I told him I didn't plan to stay bedridden for the next three months.
