                (formerly Minetest) has three parts: an open-source "boxel" game engine for making
                games like Minecraft, a distribution platform for creators, and an application for
                players. As an open-source project, Luanti games and mods will live for as long as
                someone has them installed and is willing to share. Usage of Luanti is completely
                free, and anyone can make copies or modifications to their heart's content, as long
                as they follow

                Luanti was started in 2010 and active development continues today! I became a
                contributor in December 2024 when Luanti contributors started

                migrate content, fix typos, and categorize pages. As the project progresses, I'm
                sure you'll see me update styles, fix accessibility issues, and really ensure that
                anyone who wants to learn about Luanti will have their answers clearly presented.
