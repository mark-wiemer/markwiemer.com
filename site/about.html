                I was born with half a heart shortly before the turn of the millennium near
                Milwaukee, WI, USA, Earth. My childhood in a loving home with loving parents and
                three siblings was uneventful - I spent most of my time reading, writing fantasy
                books, playing with friends and with Hot Wheels cars, and generally just imagining.
                We were raised Catholic, and I went to a private school until we moved to the
                suburbs when I was about 9. From there, I continued my merry life of making armor
                out of pizza boxes and accidentally injuring myself. I even started playing
                Minecraft.

                A few years after I accidentally hit myself in the back of the head with an axe, I
                became a high schooler. In between, I was hit by a major bout of depression that
                plagues me to this day. I have struggled with many episodes of suicidality, but with
                help from the aforementioned family, the friends I made along the way, and caring
                teachers and counselors, I've learned how to cope (and take daily anti-depressants).
                Otherwise, high school continued like most school: Easy, engaging, boring, and full
                of socialization.
            </p>
            <p>
                When high school began, so did my software career. When I sat down to learn Visual
                Basic, I thought I'd be typing 1s and 0s into a green terminal - I was never more
                shocked than when I learned we could write code with regular words.

                After the girl I loved found someone else, your 16-year-old author started dating
                someone who ended up raping him. That was not fun. We broke up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the breakup, though, I started my "volunteer career" as a camp counselor.
                Turning Rivers will forever hold a special place in my heart. The amazing work that
                program does for so many kids is beyond magical. I am incredibly thankful for their
                presence in this world. Unfortunately, with The Pandemic That Shall Not Be Named and
                my move across the country, this "career" was paused after just a few years.

                I went through college as most other students did. My magic super brain gave me good
                grades, I socialized plenty but rarely drank, I developed PTSD from the
                aforementioned sexual assaults (and some not-mentioned sexual assaults in college),
                I built my own apps, and I read about the FIRE movement (though I've never
                identified with it). Just your average college experience. My mom says I dated
                around* but I maintain I dated asquare. Heh. Moving on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew going into college I would be a software engineer (or industrial engineer, or
                maybe something else), but it took a few months to realize I loved teaching.
                Education became my goal, and I'm still exploring more ways to deliver that - with
                code, with articles, with guidance for teachers and delivering my own lectures to
                students. This blog has become a great first step. Thank you for reading. Throughout
                college I was a math tutor, computer science teaching assistant, and coding club
                leader - all of which were immensely rewarding.

                    *OK, she said "I dated a lot of girls," but that doesn't lend itself as well to
                    my pun.

                I studied abroad in France. I speak French. Kinda. It's kind of a big deal. Kinda.
                But less importantly, my host mom verbally abused me and I developed a fear of
                roommates that I didn't get over until I moved to the West Coast of the United
                States and didn't have roommates. Oh and I climbed a mountain a few times while I
                was there. In France, that is.

                I also learned some things in college. My Catholic upbringing and awesome parents
                instilled a strong moral sense in me, and after some philosophy and ethics courses I
                resolved to just plain not deceive people. I think that's wrong. I'm not sure why
                other people do that. It's not cool.
            </p>

            <p>
                I tried to learn why other people do that by studying the brain - biology,
                neurophysiology, psychology, sociology, all that fun stuff. No luck, unfortunately,
                but I now know a bunch of cool Latin words for brain parts. Or, well, I did. I'm
                sure my flash cards are somewhere around here…

                Most important, of course, was making friends with a wonderful young woman who was a
                photographer, as it turned out, and getting this great headshot for free:

                    I like this shirt because it's full of equal signs. It covers my love of math
                    and social justice! 🤓

                I now live on the aforementioned Coast in or around Seattle, working for Microsoft,
                rock climbing when I can, and doing my best to avoid video games. For over a year,
                I've spent more on charity then I've spent on myself - no one should starve - but
                this may not be sustainable. I eat the same dish of tofu with peanut sauce and
                vegetables nearly every day for some reason, and it wasn't until February of this
                year that I got into AI.
            </p>

                In late 2021, I suffered a major mental breakdown from depression and took two
                months off work to recover. During that time I developed a renewed faith in God that
                I'm still exploring. I go to a Bible study of sorts about every week with a bunch of
                old Catholic men (including my dad), and I've learned a lot from them, from my
                family, and from my personal studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I'm honored to be a Big Brother through BBBS. I've been matched with my
                Little for over 2 years now and I love playing Magic and Minecraft, watching movies,
                and just talking about life with him. He's the best.

                I hope this helped you understand the person behind the words a bit better. Remember
                that every article you read and interaction you have is attached to a story - a
                person - just like this, except a lot different. Isn't that amazing? I think it's
                pretty neat.
